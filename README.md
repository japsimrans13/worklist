# worklistfrontend

A  Todo Application frontend using Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project connects to RestAPI created using Django Rest Framework (running on Heroku).

User can login using username and password and the API endpoint returns a JWT (JSON Web Token), which is stored in the local storage of mobile and for further authentications this JWT is used (this helps in minimizing the login attempts).

Credentials for guest login (these username and password are only for testing purpose) :
# username : testuser1
# password : 123abc99pp
